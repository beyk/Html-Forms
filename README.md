# Html-Forms
In this project, we cloned the Sign Up page for mint.com. We created the logos sections, form area and footer section.

In this project, we created:

1. Sign in section at the top-right part of the page.
2. Sign up form as the main section of the page. We have three input fields and a create account button. We also have privacy policy and terms of service declaration in a paragraph inside the form area.
3. Footer section with copyright declaration at the bottom of the page.
